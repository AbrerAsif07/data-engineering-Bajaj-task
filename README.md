# data-engineering-Bajaj-task



Overview:This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (DataEngineeringQ2\_analysis.ipynb) and supporting documentation for analyzing the DataEngineeringQ2.json dataset.  learn how to:

*   Load and inspect raw JSON data in Python.
    
*   Normalize nested JSON into a Pandas DataFrame.
    
*   Parse dates and compute derived features (e.g., patient age).
    
*   Count list-based fields (e.g., number of prescribed medicines).
    
*   Validate custom data (e.g., Indian phone numbers) with user-defined functions.
    
*   Perform basic statistical analysis (Pearson correlation).
    
*   Visualize data distributions and relationships using Matplotlib.
    

Getting Started
---------------

1.  git clone https://github.com/YOUR\_USERNAME/data-engineering-q2.gitcd data-engineering-q2
    
2.  Using conda (recommended)conda create -n dataqs python=3.10 pandas matplotlib jupyterlabconda activate dataqs
    
3.  jupyter lab
    
4.  **Open the notebook**
    
    *   In the file browser, click DataEngineeringQ2\_analysis.ipynb.
        
5.  **Follow the step-by-step cells**
    
    *   Each cell is annotated with explanations—run them sequentially to replicate the analysis.
